tintamp - The Integer Amplifier
===============================

tintamp is a guitar amp. modeller suitable to low power devices whose
main CPU has no FPU. It is based purely on fixed point arithmetic.

Required libraries
-----------------

* Jack >= 0.9 (jack-audio-connection-kit-devel, libjack-jackd2-dev)
* GTK+ >= 3.0 (gtk3-devel, libgtk-3-dev)

The GTK+ requirement is optional (and can be disabled by passing --without-gtk
to ./configure) but strongly recommended if you want to explore tintamp's
capabilities interactively on a PC.

Building
--------

From a distributed package the build process is the standard GNU autotools
approach:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If you obtained tintamp via git you must generate the configure script
and Makefile templates first:

  autoreconf -i
